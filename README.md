You need to start the postgres database and create a schema called gallery with a user of admin and password of admin. Then open a REPL (e.g. lein repl) and type:

    $lein repl
    
    user> (use 'picture-gallery.models.schema)
    user> (create-users-table)
    user> (create-images-table)
    user> (quit)

These commands will create the necessary tables in the postgresql database. Once you have done this you can run the application.
